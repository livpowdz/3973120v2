    <h1> Liv's Assessment Folio! </h1>

    <p> This webpage is a portfolio of my work from the semester! On this page, I reflect on the past three design projects using three different software and media styles. I also attempt to provide a recount of the process I underwent in creating each of these projects. 

      Yes, this page has specific reflections on the tasks and the way I felt in tackling them. However, I want to also reflect on this semester as a whole, being it was my first semester at RMIT. Starting a new degree, with little previous experience in the areas i anticipated to cover; was kind of nerve-racking. I am self-aware of my tendency to get overly frustrated and upset when I am not good at a task or don’t have the skills to perform it well. This usually results in me quitting, restarting or not pushing through.  As we started working on the various design projects throughout the Semester, this tendency was very apparent to me. However, after using the deadlines of due dates to motivate me to complete these “frustrating” tasks; I was very proud. This semester I have learnt to push beyond my points of frustration to get things done and while the final product may not be my proudest work, I learnt to still get the job done even if it's not its best result. 
      
      Throughout this semester I have also experienced significant road bumps in terms of sickness and mental health. My physical health and mental health have been variable and up and down throughout this semester and it really impacted my motivation towards each of my uni classes. I was lucky that I managed to complete all my assignments in a timely fashion. I definitely think there were times of laziness when I lacked the discipline to complete homework or class tasks; but overall, I did my best given my circumstances. 
      
      The main thing that I want to improve on moving forward in my academic career is my ability to work on and familiarise myself with content outside of class. Especially for the 3 design projects this semester; I should have dedicated more time to understanding and familiarising myself with the software needed for the assessments. This may have helped me be more efficient and skilful allowing for a better final submission. 
       </p>

    <h2> Assessment 1 </h2> 
        <h3> Reflection </h3>

        <p> The first assessment task was my favourite project this semester. I enjoyed using Premiere Pro and the original footage and audio to create a piece of my artistic direction. However, I found that I had the least creative approach to this assessment task and was restricted by the material I had to work with. 

          It was an exciting task that challenged my creative freedom by restricting where I could take the storyline, aesthetics, concept, etc. Despite some frustration that I may have felt towards the task, I think I enjoyed it the most, being someone who came into this course doing lots of editing and filmmaking—learning and becoming comfortable with Premiere as the software was also an enjoyable but rewarding process. Before this semester, I was unfamiliar with Premiere; thus, working on Assignment 1 was a slow process. 
          
          I think that if I had previous experience with Premiere Pro or similar software, I would have been able to have much more detail and edits in my final submission. I am proud of what I produced given the circumstances; however, experience with the software would have accelerated the basic steps of cutting and adjusting clips - giving more time for other parts of the design process. 
           </p>

        <h4> The Process </h4>

        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
        <style>
        * {
          box-sizing: border-box;
        }
        
        .column {
          float: left;
          width: 50%;
          padding: 10px;
          height: 300px; 
        }
        
        .row:after {
          content: "";
          display: table;
          clear: both;
        }
        </style>
            
        <div class="row">
          <div class="column" style="background-color:white;">
            <p> The process I underwent in creating this task was not overly complex. I began by watching and scrubbing through all of the provided video footage and moved towards a decision to use the ‘This is Marshall McLuhan: The Medium is the Message’ as my video material for the task. I waited til after deconstructing and rough editing this video to make this decision for my audio source; ‘Alone at Home.

              I got a rough idea for the thematic direction of my project. I dissected the footage into short clips that stood out to me. I wanted to create an art piece with a semi-hidden storyline. The original footage featured many stills that were eerie, grunge and abstract. I used these face-paced cuts during the high-intensity portion of my piece. 
              
              From the early stages of the design process, I knew that I wanted to play around with the speed of cuts in conjunction with the pace and rhythm of background music. The piece's more “prominent” storyline arose towards the end of the design process. I decided to incorporate the shots of the girl dancing, the heartbeat and the breathing sound FX at the beginning and the future. This was an attempt to articulate that the chaos and fast-paced cuts in the middle portion of the edit were occurring in “the mind”. I think with more time to work on this piece; I may have been able to convey this better, as I’m not sure if it's easily detectable.
              
              I selected a song by Labrinth as the backing track for my piece. I realised I could not use it as it was not copyright free. I then created my song using GarageBand. I worked closely with my friend, looking for timed crescendos, pace changes, and fade-outs.

    <h2> Assessment 2 </h2> 
        <h3> Reflection </h3>

        <p> I was the most invested and dedicated to the second assessment task, committing significantly more time to this project. I was lucky to have an iPad which allowed me to use my drawing skills in illustrator. If I had done the task using a laptop/desktop, the outcome would have been very different. 

          In this task, I felt the most creative freedom as I could ultimately decide on my icons independently, as long as they were cohesive and aligned with one of the provided prompts. I enjoyed this task and spent a lot of time on each icon: drawing, adjusting, colouring, etc.
          
          My main challenge in completing this assessment task was creating and formatting the HTML webpage to display the nine icon designs. I had some issues embedding my icons onto the page as they were distorted in shape and size. This took some adjusting and alteration; however, I could present it as nicely as possible in the end. 
           </p>

        <h4> The Process </h4>
        
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
        <style>
        * {
          box-sizing: border-box;
        }
        
        .column {
          float: left;
          width: 50%;
          padding: 10px;
          height: 300px; 
        }
        
        .row:after {
          content: "";
          display: table;
          clear: both;
        }
        </style>
            
        <div class="row">
          <div class="column" style="background-color:white;">
            <p> The process for this task was the most straightforward. It began with identifying which of the prompts I connected with most and felt I could do the most with creatively. I selected the dream promptly and started by brainstorming and doing word association to generate some ideas and get the creative juices flowing. From there, I began to work on some basic thumbnail sketches of what I wanted to try and create. I also looked online for some flat designs relating to some of the ideas I had for inspiration. I then began drawing up my ideas in Illustrator. As the design process went on, I started developing more of a colour palette and was conscious of including colours across icons to ensure a level of unity. </p>

    <h2> Assessment 3 </h2>
        <h3> Reflection </h3>

        <p> This assessment task was the hardest I struggled with and found the most difficult. I had zero experience prior to this assessment with software like Unity or working with digital elements. I felt restricted by my skill level in creating the virtual environment. I wanted my transformation to occur with animated features and colour changes. However, due to my skill level, I had to develop my transformation differently and instead have it happen as the “player” walked through the environment. 

          Not only did I have issues with Unity as a result of a lack of experience and knowledge of the software. But I also experience significant technical difficulties right before submitting the task. Right before I was going to screen record a play-through o my Unity build, I got an error message preventing me from pressing ‘play’. I had to combat this by submitting what I had available. This resulted in me submitting a video of my virtual environment from the editor's perspective rather than the player asset/camera POV. 
           </p>

        <h4> The Process </h4>
                
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
        <style>
        * {
          box-sizing: border-box;
        }
        
        .column {
          float: left;
          width: 50%;
          padding: 10px;
          height: 300px; 
        }
        
        .row:after {
          content: "";
          display: table;
          clear: both;
        }
        </style>
            
        <div class="row">
          <div class="column" style="background-color:white;">
            <p> The planning and creation process was reasonably straightforward despite any personal creative and skill blocks I experienced. Selecting my concept for the virtual environment was relatively simple. My idea stemmed from a childhood memory I had with my family. 

              When I was around 8-10 years old, my family decided to get professional photos taken. The place where we took these photos was a path through lots of trees during autumn. With falling leaves and crunchy autumn leaves coving the ground. This inspired me to create an environment that somewhat mimicked that. I wanted to create a path through a forest of trees, with the transformation being a change in seasons represented by the colour of the foliage on the trees. 
              
              I spent a lot of time searching through the Unity asset store, trying to find the best assets to help me achieve this environment.  As I started populating my terrain with trees, I was trying to increase my familiarity with the Unity software and learn how it works.
